## How to play the game
The objective here is to cross from the grass to the water ('cause it's a hot day and you wanna stay fresh, right?).

This is you:
<div markdown style="margin-left: 10%; margin-top: -70px;">
![Character Boy](https://aboutandre.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/char-boy.png)
</div>

But those nasty bugs are keeping you from the water!

Dodge those suckers using the arrow keys:
<div markdown style="margin-left: 10%;">
![Arrow Keys](https://aboutandre.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/arrowkeys.png)
</div>


Once you reach the other side and fresh yourself up the game starts again. But now with even more bugs!

Show those [Coccinellidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccinellidae) who is the dodgier of them all and have some fun!
